Our paper, "Select Edges Wisely: Monotonic Path Aware Graph Layout Optimization for Disk-based ANN Search", is submitted to VLDB2025.

## Quick Start
### Install Dependencies
```bash
apt install build-essential libboost-all-dev make cmake g++ libaio-dev libgoogle-perftools-dev clang-format libboost-all-dev libmkl-full-dev
```
### Index Construction
Construct index on SIFT100K dataset, which is provided in `data/sift100k` directory. Go to `scripts` directory and run
```bash
bash ./run_benchmark.sh release build
```
### Graph Layout Optimization
After index construction, go to `my_gp` directory and run
```bash
bash ./mcrun.sh
```
### ANN Search
After graph layout optimization, go to `scripts` and run
```bash
bash ./run_benchmark.sh search knn
```

### Configuration
For index construction and ANN search, go to `script` directory and modify the configurations in `config_dataset.sh` and `config_local.sh`. For graph layout optimization, the only parameter `nlist` can be set in `my_gp/new_mincut.cpp`. For example, `instance->partition( base_path, 256);`
means `nlist` is set to 256. Set `nlist` to 1 for the greedy algorithm.
